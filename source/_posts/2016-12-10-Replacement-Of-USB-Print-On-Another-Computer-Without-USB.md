Let's say you are in the situation that you want to print documents like photos/review paper, but you don't have a printer at home. Then you have to print them at store or library. 
In this case, seems like the only ways to bring data to printer are copying them to USB or upload them to cloud drive and share them. 

But both solutions aren't that convenient.

### So here is a **better solution**:
find a **temporary cloud storage** site on google, upload your documents there, and use [bitly.com](https://bitly.com/) shorten the files share link (write the link on paper, and bring it with you).
Now, you can print your files on another computer without using USB.

### Benefit:
#### 1. Compare to using USB, it is virus free solution.
#### 2. Compare to uploading to personal cloud and sharing, less personal information leak.
