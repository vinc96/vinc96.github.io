I would suggest you to go with virtual box, provided your machine has atleast 4Gb RAM.

Because:
1. It is very likely that you will end up erasing your entire hard disk while installing Ubuntu. But there is no such risk when you install it in virtual box.

<!-- more -->
2. You can copy and take the virtual hard disk to other machines and attach it to virtual box there to have the same machine there as well.

3. You don't have to install all the apps at both places, for example Skype because you can always use them by just minimizing your Ubuntu.

4. When you get comfortable with Linux, you can use linux server version instead of linux desktop. Linux server is very light because of no GUI.
This way your Linux will just be a terminal and you will need to use Windows for browsers and stuff. 

Some suggestions:
1. Put the virtual hard drive in some drive other than C and don't hasitate when allocating space.

2. If you have a quad core CPU, allow the virtual machine to use atleast two.

3. Once you are in, avoid using mouse as much as you can. Try not to leave keyboard. This makes you fast.

Go learn it, you will love it. :)
Happy hunting ;)
